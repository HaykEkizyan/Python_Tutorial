The module itertools is a standard library that contains several functions that are useful in functional programming.
One type of function it produces is infinite iterators.
The function count counts up infinitely from a value.
The function cycle infinitely iterates through an iterable (for instance a list or string).
The function repeat repeats an object, either infinitely or a specific number of times.

from itertools import count

#1
for i in count(3):
    print(i)        #  3 4 5 6 7
    if i >= 7:
        break

#1.1
for i in count(3):
    print(i)        # 3
    if i >= 1:
        break
