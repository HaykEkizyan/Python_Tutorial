"""
math.ceil(x)
Return the ceiling of x, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. If x is not a float, delegates to x.__ceil__(), which should return an Integral value.

math.comb(n, k)
Return the number of ways to choose k items from n items without repetition and without order.

Evaluates to n! / (k! * (n - k)!) when k <= n and evaluates to zero when k > n.

Also called the binomial coefficient because it is equivalent to the coefficient of k-th term in polynomial expansion of the expression (1 + x) ** n.

Raises TypeError if either of the arguments are not integers. Raises ValueError if either of the arguments are negative.

New in version 3.8.

math.copysign(x, y)
Return a float with the magnitude (absolute value) of x but the sign of y. On platforms that support signed zeros, copysign(1.0, -0.0) returns -1.0.

math.fabs(x)
Return the absolute value of x.

math.factorial(x)
Return x factorial as an integer. Raises ValueError if x is not integral or is negative.

math.floor(x)
Return the floor of x, the largest integer less than or equal to x. If x is not a float, delegates to x.__floor__(), which should return an Integral value.
