                                                                    Classes
                                                                    
Objects are created using classes, which are actually the focal point of OOP.
The class describes what the object will be, but is separate from the object itself. In other words, 
 a class can be described as an object's blueprint, description, or definition.
You can use the same class as a blueprint for creating multiple different objects.
Classes are created using the keyword class and an indented block, which contains class methods (which are functions). 
                                                                    
class Cat:
  def __init__(self, color, legs):
    self.color = color
    self.legs = legs
felix = Cat("ginger", 4)
rover = Cat("dog-colored", 4)
stumpy = Cat("brown", 3)                                                                    

This code defines a class named Cat, which has two attributes: color and legs.
Then the class is used to create 3 separate objects of that class.
