The Python standard library alone contains extensive functionality.
However, some tasks require the use of third-party libraries. Some major third-party libraries:
Django: The most frequently used web framework written in Python, Django powers websites that include Instagram and Disqus.
It has many useful features, and whatever features it lacks are covered by extension packages.
CherryPy and Flask are also popular web frameworks.

For scraping data from websites, the library BeautifulSoup is very useful,
and leads to better results than building your own scraper with regular expressions.

While Python does offer modules for programmatically accessing websites, such as urllib, they are quite cumbersome to use.
Third-party library requests make it much easier to use HTTP requests.
