Python Enhancement Proposals(предложения по развитию Python) (PEP)
are suggestions for improvements to the language, made by experienced Python developers.
PEP 8 is a style guide on the subject of writing readable code.
It contains a number of guidelines in reference to variable names, which are summarized here:
- modules should have short, all-lowercase names;
- class names should be in the CapWords style;
- most variables and function names should be lowercase_with_underscores;
- constants (variables that never change value) should be CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES;
- names that would clash with Python keywords (such as 'class' or 'if') should have a trailing underscore.

PEP 8 also recommends using spaces around operators and after commas to increase readability.
However, whitespace should not be overused. For instance, avoid having any space directly inside any type of brackets.
